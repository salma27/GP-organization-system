Once the student is in the lecture, he/she will have to use their phones to connect to an access point that is set to cover the lecture room’s range.The console app will update the server with the new addresses (in the range) list continuously.

This directly empowers sound engineers and technicians to apply sound effects to specific instruments with no effect on other instruments whatsoever. Targeting exact frequencies of an instrument within a track was and still is an essential but a complex problem to tackle. To that end, composers mostly had to record each instrument separately to be able to apply the sound effects properly later on, But this is time-consuming and rather expensive budget-wise. Maestro offers a convenient solution that is free, easy to use and requires no knowledge of audio signals . Maestro stems the songs into separate files of( Drums-Bass-Violin-singer’s voice .. and other) in real-time. The application also helps instrument learners find the backing tracks for the songs they like even if they’re unpopular.

Slide Manipulation: Such as going forward and backwards and otherPowerPoint features.2. Slide Annotation: This includes many features that enable editing the slidesduring slide show such as underlining, adding slides and text, etc.3. AirWriting Feature: This feature allows the presenter to write on the air, andsuch writing will be converted into text using an innovative online characterrecognition algorithm.`, title: "Presentations on the fly"},
