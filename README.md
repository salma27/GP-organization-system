# GP organization system
The project's main objective is to automate the process of forming a graduation project team, contacting a doctor and a teacher assistant to supervise that team and introducing new ideas in a more organized efficient way if they exist or searching for useful ideas for those who don’t have any ideas yet.  
It is mainly to help the seniors of FCAI but it is also meant to help the doctors and teaching assistants. It helps the doctors to overlook all the students’ ideas and choose the ideas to supervise. It also allows the doctors to determine the technology that they are interested in supervising. This avoids receiving the doctors hundreds of mails just to see if the doctor is available or to share the basic idea and also some mails might not be seen by the doctors.  
This project allows all users to browse through countless projects related to the computer science field that might become of help to the newer generations when searching for an idea for a specific field of technology.  
the system is vote based, as any action by any student, doctor or TA will first require the majority of the team members to vote if the accept or not
